In order to understand the popularity of Linux, we need to travel back in time, about 30 years ago...
Imagine computers as big as houses, even stadiums. While the sizes of those computers posed substantial
problems, there was one thing that made this even worse: every computer had a different operating system.
Software was always customized to serve a specific purpose, and software for one given system didn't run on
another system. Being able to work with one system didn't automatically mean that you could work with
another. It was difficult, both for the users and the system administrators.
Computers were extremely expensive then, and sacrifices had to be made even after the original purchase just
to get the users to understand how they worked. The total cost per unit of computing power was enormous.
Technologically the world was not quite that advanced, so they had to live with the size for another decade. In
1969, a team of developers in the Bell Labs laboratories started working on a solution for the software
problem, to address these compatibility issues. They developed a new operating system, which was
1. Simple and elegant.
2. Written in the C programming language instead of in assembly code.
3. Able to recycle code.
The Bell Labs developers named their project "UNIX."
The code recycling features were very important. Until then, all commercially available computer systems
were written in a code specifically developed for one system. UNIX on the other hand needed only a small
piece of that special code, which is now commonly named the kernel. This kernel is the only piece of code
that needs to be adapted for every specific system and forms the base of the UNIX system. The operating
system and all other functions were built around this kernel and written in a higher programming language, C.
